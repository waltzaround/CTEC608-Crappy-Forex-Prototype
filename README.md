# CTEC608 Crappy Forex Data Visualisation

Project that pulls foreign exchange data in JSON from the Yahoo Finance v1 API into a Unity scene. It then takes the data and applies it to cubes that display the forex data in 3D. Entire thing is a proof of concept that shows you can take live data and visualize it in a 3D space.
